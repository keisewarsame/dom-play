                <p>An assignment, where we created a small, single page application using the DOM. The page requirements were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With a single click, highlight (bold or otherwise) all lines for a specific actor in a play</li>
                    <li>Un-highlight (normal or otherwise) all lines from all other actors in the play</li>
                    <li>The function(s) created to do the work must accommodate any number of actors, and any number of additional lines added to the page</li>
                    <li>The page must do the work without page re-loads (i.e. it must be done via JavaScript and the DOM)</li>
                    <li>The page may not use a third party API (jQuery, for example)</li>
                    <li>HTML "hooks" may be added to the page, meaning you can edit the HTML to enable your scripts to perform properly</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p><span data-actor="ivan">IVAN: That is a canvas held up over the face of the man I truly am. I raised both of you up as my own, therefore you are prejudice against ill opinion of me.</span></p>
                <p><span data-actor="tiara">TIARA: Yes, I may be prejudice, but what I speak is truth, regardless.</span></p>
